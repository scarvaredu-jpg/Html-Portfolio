<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Recently, I started to programming and everyday i wake up with the goal to learn everything that i can and try until it is successfully achieved. As time has passed, I have learned
  to do everything correctly in the way it needs to be. 
  Nothing is perfect but we can try and do it correctly.This experience has been a little stressful but at the moment i achieve it, I realize all the stress has a important value that will be rewarded.
