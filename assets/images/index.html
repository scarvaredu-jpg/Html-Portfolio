<h1>The best movies according to Scar!</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies off all-time </h2>
<hr>
<h3>The notebook</h3>
<p>It's my top 1 because the first time i watched the movie i was able to understand the deep meaning of the movie. Something that not all the people can feel and understand.</p>
<h3>To the bone</h3>
<p>It's my top 2 because the movie reveal a little part of the problems and feelings that the people who have this problems don't show with others. </p>
<h3>To all the boys i loved before</h3>
<p>It's a great movie and i enjoy watching it in bay days.</p>
